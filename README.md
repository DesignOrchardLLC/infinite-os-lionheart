# ∞ OS™ — Lionheart℠
> Canonical System Hierarchy  
> Version: v1.0.3 | Status: LOCKED | Authority: Design Orchard LLC

## 🏛️ The Architecture
Lionheart is not just a set of rules; it is a unified cosmology of Authority, Execution, and Memory.  
This repository contains the immutable definitions for the Operating System of Design Orchard.

## 📜 Core Artifacts
- 📜 `LIONHEART_v1.0.3.md` — The Governance Charter (Human-Readable Law)
- ⚙️ `lionheart_schema.json` — The Neuro-Forge Engine Schema (Machine-Enforceable Logic)

## 🗺️ System Topology

### I. The Authority Stack
Authority flows down; Truth flows up.

  DO["🌴 Design Orchard LLC\n(Publisher / Intent)"]
  LAB["🔬 Dr Marchand’s Lab\n(Host / Execution)"]
  LIB["📚 Dr Marchand’s Library\n(Canon / Memory)"]
  VAULT["🔐 Vault\n(Secrets / Keys)"]

  DO -- "Intent / IP / Signal" --> LAB
  LAB -- "Witness (Δ)" --> LIB
  LIB -- "Access" --> VAULT

  style DO fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px
  style LAB fill:#e6f3ff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px
  style LIB fill:#fff0e6,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px
  style VAULT fill:#333,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff

II. The Forge Chain

The inevitable flow from Null to Engine.

  N((.)) --> L((:))
  L --> D((✧))
  D --> S((✦))
  S --> O((•))
  O --> C{{"⚛︎"}}
  C --> G{{"☸︎"}}
  G --> E{{"⚙︎"}}

  style C stroke-width:2px
  style G stroke-width:2px
  style E stroke-width:4px

Rule: Reflection is only permitted inside Containment (⚛︎), Governance (☸︎), and Engine (⚙︎).
There is no return to pre-observation.

III. Validation Protocol
	•	Check Header: Must contain Authority, Role, and Scope.
	•	Validate Schema: Run lionheart_schema.json.
	•	Verify Chain: ⚗️ → 🔬 → 📚 lineage must be unbroken.

Nothing advises. Nothing coerces. Nothing escapes structure.
